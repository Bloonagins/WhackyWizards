Spell Types:
	Glossary:
		- Travel time:
			- Hitscan: immediately hits where you aimed when you click
			- Projectile: has a travel time to get to where you shot (slow, medium, or fast for now)
		- Damage per hit:
			- Self explanatory, either very low, low, medium, high, or very high for now
		- Firing speed:
			- The amount of time before the spell can shoot again
			- IMPORTANT NOTE: whoever ends up coding the spells, make sure you avoid a weapon switching bug
				this is a bug where the player can shoot a weapon, quickly switch to a different weapon and then back to the original to 
				reset the weapon's shot cooldown, thus bypassing the weapon's firing speed limitation
		- Range:
			- The distance the weapon can travel before it has no more effect / disipates / explodes
		- Charge up time:
			- The amount of time the player has to hold down click before the spell can fire
		- Hitbox size / shape:
			- The size / shape of the hitbox that the spell uses to check collisions with enemies
		- Effect:
			- How the spell functions / what it looks like on screen
		- Color theme:
			- The main color of the spell to make each one more distinguishable to the player both when fired and in the UI
