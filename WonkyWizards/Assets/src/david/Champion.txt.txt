My feature for the Whacky Wizards tower defense game will be creating the enemy characters and managing their interactions.

At the start of each round, a wave of non-player characters (NPCs) will be spawned in and move towards the goal target. My job will be creating the enemy NPCs 
and keeping track of their attributes which include hit points, speed, damage, range, and abilities. I also need to control the NPC’s movement, pathfinding, 
and targeting. I will need to make sure the enemies can’t move through the summon objects that are impassible and ensure there’s a clear path to the target 
using a pathfinding algorithm such as A*. 

Additionally, I’m responsible for the enemy NPCs interactions which the main player, summons, and goal. I will need to keep track of each enemy's damage received, damage output, position, and ability status.
